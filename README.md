# First_Lua_Script
NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) is a component of the Nmap network exploration tool. It allows users to write and execute scripts to automate a wide range of network-related tasks. NSE scripts are written in the Lua programming language and can be used to perform various tasks such as vulnerability scanning, service enumeration, and network discovery.

NSE scripts can be used to gather information about hosts, services, and vulnerabilities on a network, as well as to automate common network administration tasks. These scripts can be used to check for specific vulnerabilities, identify open ports, gather information about network services, and perform other network-related tasks.

The NSE scripting engine is highly flexible and extensible, allowing users to create their own custom scripts or use the extensive collection of pre-existing scripts available in the Nmap Scripting Database. These scripts can be executed individually or in combination with other scripts to perform complex network scanning and analysis tasks.

Overall, NSE scripts provide a powerful and versatile tool for network administrators, security professionals, and researchers to automate network reconnaissance and security assessments.
